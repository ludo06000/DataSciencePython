## Reminder of concept

### List in python : [Â ]
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
```Python
liste = ["class", "test"]
print("liste",type(liste))
```


### Dictionary in python : { }
A dictionary in Python will also allow you to collect elements but these will be identified by a key.
```Python
dictionary= {"hello", "de", "Lu"}
print("dictionary", type(dictionary))
```

### Tuple in python : ( )
Tuples are similar to lists, but cannot be modified once they have been created.
```Python
a_tuple = ("hello", "de", "lu")
print("tuple", type(a_tuple))
```
